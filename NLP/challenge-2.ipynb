    "# Challenge 2: Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge we will learn sentiment analysis and practice performing sentiment analysis on Twitter tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is to *systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information* based on texts ([reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis)). In simple words, it's to understand whether a person is happy or unhappy in producing the piece of text. Why we (or rather, companies) care about sentiment in texts? It's because by understanding the sentiments in texts, we will be able to know if our customers are happy or unhappy about our products and services. If they are unhappy, the subsequent action is to figure out what have caused the unhappiness and make improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic sentiment analysis only understands the *positive* or *negative* (sometimes *neutral* too) polarities of the sentiment. More advanced sentiment analysis will also consider dimensions such as agreement, subjectivity, confidence, irony, and so on. In this challenge we will conduct the basic positive vs negative sentiment analysis based on real Twitter tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK comes with a [sentiment analysis package](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html). This package is great for dummies to perform sentiment analysis because it requires only the textual data to make predictions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n",
    ">>> txt = \"Ironhack is a Global Tech School ranked num 2 worldwide.  ",
    " ",
    "Our mission is to help people transform their careers and join a thriving community of tech professionals that love what they do.\"\n",
    ">>> analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n",
    ">>> analyzer.polarity_scores(txt)\n",
    "{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.8442}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, however, you will not use NLTK's sentiment analysis package because in your Machine Learning training in the past 2 weeks you have learned how to make predictions more accurate than that. The [tweets data](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) we will be using today are already coded for the positive/negative sentiment. You will be able to use the Naïve Bayes classifier you learned in the lesson to predict the sentiment of tweets based on the labels."

The bag of words contains all the unique words in your whole text body (a.k.a. *corpus*) with the number of occurrence of each word. It will allow you to understand which words are the most important features across the whole corpus.\n",

A convenient library to calculate the term frequency distribution is NLTK's `FreqDist` class ([documentation](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html#module-nltk.probability)).
